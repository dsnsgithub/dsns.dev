## Bluesky: The Future of Social Media

Bluesky is the newest decentralized social media platform that attempts to replace Twitter. With anyone being able to host their own server, Bluesky is a "billionaire-proof" platform that is free from the control of any one company. New social media comes with benefits, like being able to set your username as your domain name.


## With freedom comes features (comments)
Bluesky allows us to create a comment section that [uses Bluesky posts as blog comments](https://emilyliu.me/blog/comments).
[Cory Zue](https://www.coryzue.com/writing/bluesky-comments/) even created an npm package called [bluesky-comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluesky-comments) that allows us to easily add Bluesky comments to our blog (huge thanks to him!!). 

This would not have been possible with Twitter in its current state, as Twitter is a centralized platform that now charges money for access to its API.


## Enjoy the comments section!!

This will be the first blog on my website to have a comment section. I am excited to see how this will turn out. Feel free to leave a comment below and follow me on Bluesky!
